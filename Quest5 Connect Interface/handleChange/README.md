## Handle change

### Instructions

Create a web page, `handleChange.html` that, similarly to the prior exercice, contains a `Connect` button that triggers metamask window that asks the user to connect an account.

Once connected, it displays:
- the address of the wallet.
- The ID and common name (if available) of the current network 

When an user changes the account or the network on MetaMask, the change should be reflected in the page.
